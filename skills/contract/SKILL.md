description: "Use after the architecture sign-off to decompose the approved PRD and technical design into implementation contracts: self-sufficient per-workstream work orders (boundaries, internal design, TDD seeds, mock retirement, AC ownership) plus an index with dependencies, thin slice, and integration steps. Gates the contract tree before build. Normally invoked automatically by build; run directly only to prepare or revise contracts without building."

# contract

One contract = one implementer's complete work order. This layer merges the old spec + plan:
internal design detail and boundary discipline live together so a fresh subagent needs nothing else.

## Load

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/core-contract.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/formats/impl-contract-format.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/packs/mock-retirement.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/packs/risk-readiness.md`
- For the gate: `packs/gate-protocol.md` + `rubrics/impl-contract.md`

## Process

1. Precheck freshness of PRD and technical reviews (`check_freshness.py`). Stale ⇒ stop and route.
2. Partition the work into independently implementable contracts. Partition rules:
   - every PRD AC owned by exactly one contract; every mock inventory entry owned by exactly one;
   - parallel-safe contracts share no allowed paths;
   - thin slice first when risk categories exist, everything risky depending on it;
   - prefer fewer, fuller contracts over many thin ones — dispatch overhead is real.
3. Write each `C-XX-<name>.md` per the format: boundary globs, AC references (never restated
   text), internal design (module split, state handling, local component decisions — the detail
   technical.md deliberately excludes), TDD seeds concrete enough to start RED, mock retirement
   assignments, done-means checklist.
4. Write `index.md`: dependency table, parallel-safety column, thin slice, ordered integration
   steps the controller will run.
5. L0 precheck every file (`validate_artifacts.py <contract-file> --prd docs/features/<slug>/prd.md`), then gate
   the tree with a fresh reviewer on `rubrics/impl-contract.md`. The reviewer reads contracts
   cold — buildability by a stranger is the bar. Fix and re-gate until Approved; ledger rounds.

## Fail-open

A partition that cannot avoid shared paths means the contracts are wrong-shaped — merge them or
serialize them in the index rather than shipping a known collision. Questions the artifacts can't
answer route `revise` upstream; do not paper over gaps with invented internal design that
contradicts technical.md.

## Output

`docs/features/<slug>/contracts/` tree, gate Approved, ledger entries. Next: `build`.
