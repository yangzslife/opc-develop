description: "Use to assess or build a project's harness — the run/reset/observe/drive capabilities that let agents work verifiably. Scores each verb by executing, not by reading docs; builds missing capabilities as executable scripts/seeds/log conventions with each verified by use; consumes gap entries from feature ledgers as its backlog. Replaces harness-init and harness-eval."

# harness

The harness is executable capability, not documentation. Docs index; scripts prove.

## Load

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/core-contract.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/packs/harness-verbs.md`

## Process

### Assess (default when asked to evaluate)

1. Score each verb 0-5 in 0.5 steps **by doing**: actually run the start command, actually reset
   and seed, actually trace one request through the logs, actually run one Tier-1 spec. A
   capability that exists only in a document scores as absent.
2. Anchors: 0 = verb impossible; 2 = possible with hand-discovery each time; 3.5 = documented and
   executable but gaps in coverage; 5 = one command, deterministic, agent-proven.
   Caps: never score `observe` ≥4 without correlation IDs reconstructing one action's chain;
   never score `drive` ≥4 without named seeds; never score any verb 4.5+ from plans or partial
   evidence; cap 3.5 overall when mocks/fixtures touch real secrets or production data.
3. Report per verb: score, evidence of what was executed, the label caps current gaps impose,
   and the top 3 highest-leverage builds.

### Build (default when asked to initialize or improve)

4. Backlog = assessment gaps + `gap` entries from feature ledgers (`opc_ledger.py summary`).
   Order by label-cap impact: what blocks `local real service passed` claims comes first;
   `reset`/seed usually beats new tooling.
5. Build each capability as the executable thing itself — make targets, seed scripts with named
   scenarios, log configuration (four elements: JSON lines, correlation ID, fixed path, recipe in
   AGENTS.md), state-dump command, read-only DB recipe, Tier-1 spec scaffolding. Follow the L1-L4
   standards in `harness-verbs.md`.
6. Verify each build by using it once for real; record the command and output. Update AGENTS.md
   as the index pointing at everything built (keep it thin — pointers, not prose).
7. Offer optional L0 wiring: project-local hooks or CI steps invoking `validate_artifacts.py` /
   `check_freshness.py` at gate points. Install only with the human's yes — hooks change the
   project's behavior for everyone.

## Fail-open

Capabilities that need human-held access (production credentials, provider dashboards) become
documented handoff points, not fabricated capabilities. Building never blocks on scoring — a bare
repo starts at build step 5 with `run` and `reset`.

## Output

Assessment report with per-verb scores and evidence, and/or built capabilities each verified by
use, updated AGENTS.md index, closed `gap` entries.
