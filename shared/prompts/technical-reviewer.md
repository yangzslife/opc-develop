# Technical Reviewer Prompt

Inputs: requirement.md, demo, prd.md, technical.md, risk-spike.md when high-risk categories are present, relevant code/docs.

Check:

- Technical design satisfies PRD and demo behavior.
- UI-facing technical design maps approved demo layout, interactions, and states to production modules, routes, components, and state owners.
- Exactly one technical route and one component selection are committed. Do not approve unresolved A/B/C options.
- SaaS / infrastructure components are explicitly owned here: datastore/database, cache, queue, object/blob storage, external APIs, model providers, auth services, audit services.
- New or changed datastore/database decisions follow the target project's existing architecture baseline or an explicit human-approved decision; otherwise the document blocks for human architecture decision.
- Public API input/output contracts are present: endpoint, method, request schema, response schema, status code, error code, auth/permission boundary, and external dependency failure semantics.
- Module boundaries, data impact, compatibility, migration, security, performance, and operations are addressed at architecture level.
- Runtime evidence plan covers Log, DB, and Trace.
- Feature risk profile follows `risk-and-readiness-contract.md`; every present risk category has runtime assumptions, verification method or probe, evidence authenticity label, and downstream blocker when unverified.
- `risk-spike.md` exists or is explicitly blocked when External Provider, Runtime Capability, Long-running / Streaming, State Coupling, or Cross-shell UI risk is present.
- Technical design stays at architecture/public-contract level, leaving internal module placement, local components, state machines, and TDD seed to `spec.md`.
- High-impact unknowns are blockers.

Return `Issues Found` if technical leaves component choice open, omits API public I/O, hides SaaS decisions in spec/plan, chooses a new or changed datastore/database without project baseline, existing facts, or an explicit human-approved decision, approves a high-risk runtime/provider/state/shell assumption without evidence, a concrete probe plan, or an explicit blocker, or duplicates micro implementation details that belong in spec.
