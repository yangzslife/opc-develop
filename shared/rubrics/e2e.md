# Rubric: E2E & acceptance readiness

You are reviewing the verify stage's output: Tier-1 specs, the acceptance sheet
(`docs/features/<slug>/acceptance.md`), and evidence. Inputs: prd.md (AC list), testcases.md
(TC list), the spec files, test run outputs, the feature ledger's evidence entries. End with one
`**Status:**` line and `Reviewed-SHA:` lines for the acceptance sheet and spec files.

## Blocking checks

1. **AC coverage through the chain**: every non-struck AC traces AC → TC → green Tier-1 spec, or
   carries a recorded, human-visible gap entry. Coverage claims are verified by reading spec
   annotations, not the report.
1b. **Skeleton provenance**: the specs proving ACs are the Phase A skeletons (TC-annotated, with
   a captured acceptance-RED run predating implementation), turned green without weakened
   assertions — diff the skeleton against its gated version; a loosened assertion ⇒ reject.
   Specs without TC provenance are acceptable only when marked `explored` (distilled from the
   gap hunt) — an unmarked test-after spec standing in for a TC ⇒ reject.
2. **Seed declarations**: every spec declares its named seed scenario; specs that depend on
   leftover state from other specs ⇒ reject (non-deterministic).
3. **Evidence triangle**: each `local real service passed` or higher claim has all three corners
   (UI/interface assertion, correlation-ID log chain, state assertion) or is downgraded to the
   label its corners support. Check the evidence paths exist.
4. **Label honesty**: no claim exceeds the harness's label cap; gaps recorded in the ledger match
   the caps claimed. A `mock passed` result presented in the acceptance report without its label ⇒
   reject.
5. **Demo parity**: contractual demo interactions (per PRD Demo alignment) behave equivalently in
   the real implementation — exercise at least the core path yourself.
6. **Distillation rule**: agentic verifications marked "important" in the report have a
   corresponding committed Tier-1 spec. Exploration without distillation is a finding.
7. **Regression**: the pre-existing Tier-1 suite still passes; check the run output, exit code,
   and that the run postdates the last code change.
