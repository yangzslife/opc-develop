# Rubric: demo / prototype

You are reviewing a running frontend prototype (or runnable skeleton for non-UI features) against
requirement.md and the mock inventory. You must actually exercise it — a review from screenshots
or code reading alone is invalid. End with one `**Status:**` line and `Reviewed-SHA:` lines for
the inventory and any reviewed docs; record the preview URL/command you exercised.

## Blocking checks

1. **It runs and is reachable**: start it per the documented command, open the preview URL (or run
   the skeleton command). Failure to launch ⇒ Issues Found, no further checks needed.
2. **Real-codebase integration**: the prototype lives in the project's real frontend on the feature
   branch. Reject: detached playground apps, query-param-only alternate roots, entry points that
   exist in code but are not reachable through the real UI shell.
3. **Fidelity**: layout, interaction, and state transitions are close enough to judge taste —
   target ≥80% of the intended experience. Placeholder styling in secondary areas is fine;
   placeholder *interaction* in the core path is not.
4. **Requirement coverage**: every key path in requirement.md's acceptance signals can be walked
   in the prototype. List any that cannot.
5. **Mock inventory honesty**: every faked behavior you encounter while exercising the prototype
   has an inventory entry (id, file, type, scenario, replacement). Undocumented mocks are the
   single most dangerous defect here — hunt for them.
6. **No backend mutations**: the prototype changed no backend/production code. Frontend-only mocks.

## Non-UI variant (runnable skeleton)

Checks 1, 4, 5 apply unchanged; for 2-3, verify the skeleton exercises one real request/response
chain with production-shaped data (a stub returning the real schema counts; a hardcoded print does not).
