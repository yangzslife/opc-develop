description: "Use after the demo gate is Approved to produce and gate the PRD: decision sheet with numbered PD records, AC-IDs, state machine, permissions, and appendix. Ends at the product sign-off touchpoint (typically the PM), then commits and pushes the feature branch as the product-to-architecture handoff."

# prd

Convert the experienced prototype into the product taste document. Owned by whoever holds product
judgment — the PM in a duo, the builder solo. Ends with a pushed branch another person can pick up.

## Load

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/core-contract.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/formats/prd-format.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/packs/decision-protocol.md`
- For the gate: `packs/gate-protocol.md` + `rubrics/prd.md`

## Process

1. Precheck upstream freshness (`check_freshness.py` on the demo review). Stale ⇒ route per
   `feedback-routing.md`.
2. From requirement.md, the exercised demo, and the mock inventory, write `prd.md` per the
   format. ACs are the spine — every contractual demo behavior, acceptance signal, and edge case
   maps to a numbered AC. The decision sheet stays ≤2 pages; contested decisions get numbered PD
   records with the five-piece set; product one-way doors are tagged.
3. Gate the PRD (fresh reviewer, `rubrics/prd.md`, L0 precheck via `validate_artifacts.py`).
   Fix-and-re-gate until Approved. Ledger each round.
4. **Product sign-off touchpoint**: present the decision sheet to the product owner. Two-way
   doors were decided and logged; `[ONE-WAY]` PD records need an explicit yes. Feedback routes
   tune/revise/park.
5. **Handoff**: commit the feature artifacts and push the feature branch. Print a handoff
   summary for the architect: branch name, demo entry point, AC count, open questions with
   triggers, risk profile, and any recorded gaps.

## Fail-open

Product questions the demo/requirement can't answer go back to the product owner as five-piece
decisions — never guessed. If the demo gate is missing entirely (legacy or imported feature),
record the gap, note the fidelity caps it implies, and continue with the human's ack.

## Output

`prd.md` (gated, PD/AC numbered), pushed feature branch, handoff summary, ledger entries.
Next: `architect` — same person or a different one.
